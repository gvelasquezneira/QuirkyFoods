# Sock Market

This is a simple database application for beginners. It uses:

* A MySQL database
* HTML5 forms
* JavaScript with a jQuery Ajax request
* PHP scripts to connect to the database and write a new row into the database

This application can:

* Create a new record and add it to the database
* View all records in the database
* Update an existing record
* Delete an existing record

As an exercise in [a Web development course](https://webappsplus.wordpress.com/), this is the students' second experience with PHP and MySQL.

These are their instructions:

* [Sock Market: MySQL and PHP](http://bit.ly/mm-sockmarket) — explains the JavaScript and PHP code for viewing the database records and adding a new record, with PHP `mysqli_` commands to prevent SQL injection

* [Using the Sock Market files](http://bit.ly/mm-sockmarket-part2) — shows the relationships among all the files in this repo

* [Import or Export a Database Table](http://bit.ly/export-import-db) — how to do this in phpMyAdmin
