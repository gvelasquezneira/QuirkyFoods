# Sock Market

This is a simple database application for beginners. It uses:

* An HTML5 form
* JavaScript with an Ajax request
* PHP scripts to connect to the database and write a new row into the database
* A MySQL database

This application can:

* Create a new record and add it to the database
* View all records in the database
* Update an existing record
* Delete an existing record

As an exercise in a Web development course, this is the students' second experience with PHP and MySQL.

These are their instructions:
